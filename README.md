# ðŸ”Ž Checking the solutions

1. You need to explain how this hashing function works, line by line
   You can find a detailed explanation of how the hashing function works in the comments of the [DropERC721Mock.sol contract](./contracts/DropERC721Mock.sol)

2. You need to translate this function in a JS format, performing the same, no web3 calls are allowed.
   The translated function in JS format can be found in the [main.js file](./main.js).
   You can also check the tests written to make sure the translate function works as expected in the [test/encryptDecrypt.js](./test/encryptDecrypt.js). Run `npx hardhat test` to run them.
